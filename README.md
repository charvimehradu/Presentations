# Presentations

My favourittteeee homework to do ;)

The purpose of this repository is to keep a backup of my work and to have easy access to it for future reference. Each presentation is in a separate folder, and includes a README file with information on the topic, date, and venue of the presentation. Please be aware that these presentations were created using Microsoft PowerPoint (Version 2303) and may not function as intended on versions of PowerPoint different from the one used to create them. Some formatting may be lost, animations may not work, or other compatibility issues may arise.
